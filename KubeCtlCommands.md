To check if the specified images and their corresponding pods are running properly or are deployed in your Kubernetes cluster, you can use a combination of kubectl commands.

Given your image list and the file structure, here's a breakdown of the commands and how to use them:

1. Check Pods and their Status:

The most fundamental command to see if your pods are running is kubectl get pods.

To see all pods in the current namespace:

Bash

kubectl get pods
To see pods across all namespaces:

Bash

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
To filter pods by a specific image (this is an indirect check, as the image is part of the pod's spec):
You'll need to know the deployment, statefulset, or daemonset name that uses the image. However, you can inspect the pod's description to see its containers and their images.

To get a more detailed view of a specific pod, including the images it's using, use kubectl describe pod <pod-name>. For example:

Bash

kubectl describe pod my-n8n-pod-xyz123
Look for the "Containers" section and the "Image" field.

To specifically check pods related to your listed images, you'll generally look for common naming conventions or labels. For example, for n8n:

Bash

kubectl get pods -l app=n8n # if your n8n deployment uses a label like app=n8n
kubectl get pods | grep n8n
Similarly for other services:

confluentinc/cp-schema-registry: Look for schema-registry pods.
confluentinc/cp-zookeeper: Look for zookeeper pods.
confluentinc/cp-kafka: Look for kafka pods.
bitnami/postgresql: Look for postgresql or postgres pods.
portainer/portainer-ce: Look for portainer pods.
library/traefik: Look for traefik pods.
hashicorp/vault-k8s: Look for vault pods.
quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-controller: Look for cert-manager or cert-manager-controller pods.
quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-cainjector: Look for cert-manager-cainjector pods.
quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-startupapicheck: Look for cert-manager-startupapicheck pods.
containous/whoami: Look for whoami pods (often used for testing Traefik).
library/busybox: This is often used for init containers or ephemeral jobs, so direct pod existence might be fleeting.
rancher/mirrored-pause: This is the pause container, which exists in every pod to hold the network namespace. You won't typically check for this directly as an application.
rancher/mirrored-coredns-coredns: Look for coredns pods (usually in kube-system namespace).
2. Check Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets (Higher-Level Objects):

Pods are often managed by higher-level controllers. Checking these can give you a better overview of the desired state and current status.

Deployments: Many of your applications (n8n, schema-registry, portainer, traefik, cert-manager components) are likely managed by Deployments.

Bash

kubectl get deployments
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -o wide # -o wide shows images
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
For example, based on your file structure, you have n8n-deployment.yaml and schema-registry-deployment.yaml.

Bash

kubectl get deployment n8n-deployment
kubectl get deployment schema-registry-deployment
StatefulSets: Kafka and Zookeeper are typically deployed as StatefulSets due to their need for stable network identities and persistent storage.

Bash

kubectl get statefulsets
kubectl get statefulset <statefulset-name> -o wide
kubectl describe statefulset <statefulset-name>
Based on your kafka-services.yaml, zookeeper-deployment.yaml, and kafka.yaml, you'll likely have zookeeper and kafka statefulsets.

Bash

kubectl get statefulset zookeeper
kubectl get statefulset kafka
DaemonSets: While less likely for your specific application images, DaemonSets ensure that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod. CoreDNS is often a DaemonSet.

Bash

kubectl get daemonsets
kubectl describe daemonset <daemonset-name>
3. Check Pod Logs for Runtime Issues:

If a pod is running but experiencing issues, its logs are crucial.

Bash

kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name> -f # Follow logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> # If a pod has multiple containers
For example, to check n8n logs:

Find the n8n pod name: kubectl get pods | grep n8n
Then, view its logs: kubectl logs <n8n-pod-name>
4. Check Events for Deployment Problems:

Kubernetes events can tell you about issues like image pull failures, scheduling problems, or other errors.

Bash

kubectl get events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> # Events are included in the describe output
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name> # Events related to deployment
5. Executing Commands inside a Pod:

Sometimes you might need to execute a command inside a running container to debug.

Bash

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash # or /bin/sh
For example, to access the n8n pod:

Find the n8n pod name: kubectl get pods | grep n8n
Then, execute a shell: kubectl exec -it <n8n-pod-name> -- /bin/bash
6. Listing Images on Nodes (Advanced - for debugging image pull issues):

If you suspect image pull issues, you can check which images are actually present on your cluster nodes.

Bash

kubectl get nodes -o wide # Get node names
kubectl describe node <node-name> # Look for "Images" section
Or, even better, if you have SSH access to a node:

Bash

docker images # if docker is the container runtime
crictl images # if containerd or other CRI runtime
Example Workflow to Check your Images and Pods:

Let's take docker.io/confluentinc/cp-schema-registry:7.5.0 as an example:

Identify the relevant Kubernetes resource: From your file structure, you have services/kafka/schema-registry-deployment.yaml. This implies it's a Deployment.

Check the Deployment status:

Bash

kubectl get deployment schema-registry-deployment
Look at the READY column (e.g., 1/1) and UP-TO-DATE, AVAILABLE columns.

Get the Pods managed by this Deployment:

Bash

kubectl get pods -l app=<your-schema-registry-app-label> # You'll need to know the label from the deployment YAML
# Or, more generally, grep for it:
kubectl get pods | grep schema-registry
Once you have the pod name (e.g., schema-registry-deployment-xxxx-yyyy), check its status. It should be Running and READY.

Describe the Pod to confirm the image and look for events:

Bash

kubectl describe pod <schema-registry-pod-name>
In the output, verify the Image: field matches docker.io/confluentinc/cp-schema-registry:7.5.0 under the Containers section. Also, scroll down to the Events section to see if there are any warnings or errors (e.g., Failed to pull image, CrashLoopBackOff).

Check the Pod's logs if it's not Running or READY:

Bash

kubectl logs <schema-registry-pod-name>
General approach for your list:

For each image in your list:

Infer the Kubernetes resource type:

confluentinc/cp-schema-registry:7.5.0: Likely a Deployment (from schema-registry-deployment.yaml)
confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.5.0: Likely a StatefulSet (from zookeeper-deployment.yaml and Kafka ecosystem practices)
confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0: Likely a StatefulSet (from kafka.yaml and Kafka ecosystem practices)
n8nio/n8n:1.45.0: Likely a Deployment (from n8n-deployment.yaml)
bitnami/postgresql:16: Often a StatefulSet, but could be a Deployment.
portainer/portainer-ce:2.27.6: Likely a Deployment.
library/traefik:v3.4.1: Often a Deployment or DaemonSet.
hashicorp/vault-k8s:1.6.2: Likely a Deployment or StatefulSet.
quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-controller:v1.17.2, quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-cainjector, quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-startupapicheck: These are typically Deployments.
rancher/mirrored-coredns-coredns: DaemonSet.
containous/whoami:latest: Deployment (for testing).
library/busybox:latest: Often used in Jobs or Init Containers, so you might not find a long-running pod directly for it.
rancher/mirrored-pause: Part of every pod, not a standalone application to check.
Use kubectl get <resource-type> and kubectl describe <resource-type> <name> to check the status of the main resource.

Use kubectl get pods -l <label-selector> or kubectl get pods | grep <service-name> to find the pods.

Use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> and kubectl logs <pod-name> to dig into specific pod details and troubleshoot.

This comprehensive approach will help you ascertain the running status of your images and their associated pods within your Kubernetes cluster.
