  username: "devuser"
  password: "devpassword"
  database: "devdb" # Default database for general use
  replicationUsername: "repl_user" # Default replication user
  replicationPassword: "repl_password" # Default replication password
  # Note: The 'root' password is often auto-generated if not specified,
  # or can be explicitly set with 'auth.postgresPassword'.
  # For Bitnami charts, 'auth.password' is often the main user's password.

# Persistence: Crucial for data not to be lost on pod restarts.
# In k3d, this will use the local-path-provisioner by default if installed.

  size: 8Gi # Allocate 8GB of storage for the database
  # storageClass: "local-path" # Explicitly specify if needed, k3d defaults to this.

# Resources: Adjust based on your system's capabilities and expected load.
# These are conservative starting points.
